**Android Playground** is where I come to play with the new toys - frameworks, tools, architectures

Don't expect this code to be *"production quality"* - this are a quick&dirty experiments


### What I'm experimenting with right now
- The new [Compose Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3) library
- Navigating between screens in a different features modules
- Splitting feature modules into API/implementation - almost too powerfull, I wouldn't recommend dependencies between feature projects in a real app
- Using Hilt in a multi-module app - it's insane how much boilerplate it removes compared to pure Dagger
